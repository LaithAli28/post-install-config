Roles define permissions & control the actions that Agents (staff members) can perform within the system. They assign only the necessary levels of permissions for each user, ensuring secure and efficient helpdesk operations.

<p>
Departments deal in organizational development, primarily managing support tickets efficiently. Departments have a lot of other responsibilities such as ensuring organizational structure, proper ticket routing, and automation rules.

</p>
<p>
Teams serve a different but complementary purpose to Departments. While Departments organize tickets by category or function, Teams are used to manage agent collaboration across Departments. Teams provide cross-department collaboration, Granular Agent Assignment, Permission & Access Management, Workload Distribution, & Improved Collaboration.

</p>
<p>
Users are the individuals who create support tickets: typically the customers, clients, or end-users. Users are the ones SEEKING help, not the staff responding to tickets. Users can submit support requests, track ticket status, receive notifications, and have user profiles & history.

</p>
<p>
Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are used as a guideline to define and enforce response and resolution timeframes for support tickets. They help ensure that tickets are addressed within acceptable time limits, improving accountability and customer satisfaction. SLAs consist of time-based expectations, prioritization, automation & escalation, & performance tracking.

</p>
<p>
 Help Topics are used to categorize incoming tickets based on the type of issue or request. They help automate workflow and streamline support processes upon ticket creation. Help Topics also organize ticket categorization, automation of ticket handling, customized user experience, routing and escalation, and reporting/metrics.
